== Description ==

MASP is an advanced spam filtering web service. It can learn content and responds to incoming threats.
In short, it copes with spam efficiently.

Message

Every day each of us is bombarded with information. The rise of digital civilization makes us experience information
overload and requires a lot of effort on our part to identify what is most important. Mail, social networks or blogs
are just some of the sources of redundant information. The problem of spam itself  is slowly turning into the problem of
unwanted messages.

Auto

MASP is a service that runs without userâ€™s  intervention. Once trained, the algorithm effectively makes a selection of
the next comment. Just 50 of your decisions is enough to determine preferences and begin the automatic operation.
Whatever you do, sleep or party, MASP manages the information with reference to your user profile.

Solid

MASP Software is designed and made in accordance with modern standards in terms of performance, security and usability.
MASP is a product that has a regular technical support. Moreover, effort will be made to remove promptly any technical
problems that might occur before our customers become aware of them.

Protection

MASP provides protection from unwanted comments. In case of an incorrect assessment of comments by our algorithm, you
can always change its classification.

Each application added to the system has its own account. Therefore, the learning process is unique  as the accumulated
knowledge is related to only one particular application. Because each application has its own separate account, the
content is kept confidential.

MASP is a new look for SPAM. We strongly believe that you will find MASP to be a useful and effective tool.

IMPORTANT

MASP aims to be an all-in-one anti-spam solution. Therefore, using it along with other anti-spam plugins WILL cause
problems. PLEASE deactivate Akismet and other similar plugins before activating MASP.

1. IMPORTANT: Deactivate Akismet and/or any other anti-spam plugins by going to your Plugins tab in the WordPress
control panel. Simply click "deactivate" to deactivate the desired plugins.

   language for now)
